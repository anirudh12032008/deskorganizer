# Planing
So, I wanted to make my own modular desk organization. So, I started with the planning on Excalidraw and creating a rough sketch of what exactly I wanted to make. And then I started to take dimensions of each of the items that I was having. For example, the CMS bird was 57x57 and the books were around 210. And likewise, I took measurements of my pen, my watch, and other stuff. Then after taking all the measurements, I started to actually work on the main project.

# CMF buds pro 2 stand
So, I already have a CMF bird case printed from MakerBird. So, I was trying to make a stand for it as it kept on, like there was no fixed place to keep it. So, I took the measurements and created this design and I also added three slots for 5 mm x 1.5 mm neodymium magnet that I could use that in my structure and I have also made sure to keep the magnets at a distance of 11 mm from the base which would be the standard for each of the items because I don't want to have one item having magnet at 15 mm and one at 5 mm. So, I took the standard as the base value as 11 mm and I also left a spot for the charging cable to put in but then I sent it to print on my BambooLab A1 mini but after printing I got to know that the 57 that I was keeping there was a little bit tolerance that I didn't consider due to which the case was not fitting in perfectly. So, I would be reprinting it again later on but there is only like 0.2 or 0.3 mm gap which is needed. Without the pre existing CMF bird case it fits perfectly in there but with the case it doesn't. So, a simple fix is to just scale the model while printing to around 103% and that would work.

# Book Stand
so now i started to work on the most crucial item that is the book stand uh so i was thinking to at least have four books easily placeable in the stand so i created slot for at least four books and for the wall length i am using 4 mm as i don't want them to be too thin that heavy books could literally just break it off and for the length it's a variable length but i haven't printed it yet and i couldn't directly tell that what would be the right height to maintain a good center of mass for each book so that it doesn't just bend and make the whole structure fall or even make itself fall so currently i am using 100 mm which feels like a sweet spot and should not cause any inconvenience but yeah that's it and i am not using too much fillet on the bottom part as i don't want uh that the base structure would have some wiggling due to the printer's overhang and that might cause a little bit less strength to the part and in future i am also thinking of maybe use it as a wall mount if needed so i would just need two wall hooks in which i could directly hang it up and in this as the structure would be big plus the weight of it would be much larger than other components so i am using 10 mm cross 2 mm magnets so that the magnetic strength is pretty decent so it just doesn't cause it to lose contact directly and should have a little bit attraction though this would not be able to be printed on my bamboo lap a1 mini because the bed size is small but i know a friend of mine who has a bamboo lap a1 and also a bamboo lap b2s so i would be using his printer to print the uh to print it so that i don't split it and print into half cause that would cause a lot of a significant amount of loss and strength due to the joining of parts

## 12/25/2025 5 PM - Made the complete drawer  

_Time spent: 3.5h_  

So I started working on creating the drawer. Initially, I took inspiration from normal drawers only. So I tried to not take help from my friend this time for printing this. So I kept the dimensions according to my A1 mini only, which is under 150x150. So I started by making three major compartments in which the bottom compartment could be divided into multiple divisions using slits, which I have also created, or it could be used as one whole itself. For the upper part, I have kept one compartment smaller in size, which is of course for stuff which are small and another medium-sized container adjacent to it. I tried to keep the dimension of the whole box 150x150. I learned a new section analysis in Fusion 360 while trying to create it. I have kept the tolerance as 0.4 mm from both sides, that means 0.8 mm, so that the sliding remains smooth. And even if it's too loose, it won't really have too much effect. Then, I have also attached 4 10x2mm magnet across both the sides so that I could stick either my CMF or the book stand directly with it. And on the top part, I have given 5 10x2mm magnets to attach another top plate, which could be used to contain items or store stuff. And that also has some magnets in it to directly attach the book stand to it. Items or store stuff. And that also has some magnets in it to directly attach wherever you want. You could also use that top plate as a different lid to hold stuff, or you could use it on the top of it. For the top plate also, I have created two different slits. If you need to divide it, you could divide it further. So it's basically a part of the box and the compartment systems only. Just that it does not have a top wall, which one side saves filament also, and second side gives it a good look and make it detachable so that if needed, we could place it or we could use it individually. The filament weight comes out to be around 1100 grams. I tried to avoid supports. So there are actually no supports overall in the whole print. The difficult part was creating the handles. I'm not sure if the handles will sustain as they seem to be too thin. But I will see while printing that what would happen. But other things look good. I have kept the infill from 15 to 20% only. Because weight is not an issue. But I made sure that the strength remains good and it don't just break under weight or pressure.

## 12/29/2025 11 AM - Created the pen stand  

_Time spent: 3.5h_  

# Pen Stand
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE4MTcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--40fbf62daf9ca952be18c629c9900bff5f0e0852/image.png)
so after finishing the uh cabinet stuff i started to work on the pen stand i don't want to make the pen stand idle for just pens i wanted to make it uh accessible for other items also for example if i got maybe glue or stationary item or for example i got some uh lithium ion cells and etc stuff so i added special slots for just the pen insert i have used 11.5 mm as the diameter because the biggest pen that i was having was of 11 mm only so still to not avoid any conflicts i used 11.5 mm because thin pen can also fit well and i was trying to make it look uh great so i tried the tilted thing and it went really great so now it's in the tilted position and then i added some not compact kind of compartments also for stuff that i might need to keep in the stationary related stuff for example scissors and um staplers and all and i have also left a very thin slot on the rightmost area which is for the bookmarks i have a lot of 3d printed bookmarks lying around so uh they would act as a good source and stick to it in this overall design i haven't used any magnets as i believe this could be a standalone one and attaching magnet would destroy the pattern that i was trying to create which took some time initially i was watching some youtube videos to learn about how to create good patterns and i found the honeycomb and stuff but i wasted a lot of time but still i couldn't get it working uh here are some of the attachments also which could show that i worked a lot on it but i eventually failed because uh first of all my machine was lagging a lot when selecting all the phases and secondly i didn't knew too much about fusion i'm still learning it so there might be some good features but i was missing on them so i couldn't really get it working
So, after trying a lot on the Gradle pattern, I couldn't get it working, and Fusion was also on not my side. So I decided to try something else cause I couldn't leave it as a plain pattern cause that looks really ugly on my desk. So I decided to use this line pattern that I saw on Makerworld and multiple objects. Initially I was thinking to keep the lines as close as possible and thin, but then I found that 11 lines in 20mm separation, 70 cross 2, so 147mm separation, seems a sweet spot so I selected that and initially I was thinking of keeping it only on the right and left side, but I tried to make the pattern look like it was going all over the stand and even on the bottom area. After this was done, the other issue I felt was that the front area was directly empty and it would obviously occupy space on my desk, but the front was, front would be a useless thing. Also the concern was regarding the gravity and the center of mass as whether the structure would fall due to weight in the front area as the base area had a tilt. So I decided to add another front area which is about the same as much as the tilted areas coming out. So after adding that, I also added the pattern in there and it could act as a sweet spot for keeping my glasses or just casually anything.
As this print is around 600 grams, so I didn't wanted to have a failed print or failed item. So I decided to have this frontal area which would avoid any issues and also adds another utility to this. Also, I am using Gyroid infill and in the previous models I used Grade. So I would be switching them back to Gyroid because I forgot that we need to use Gyroid in structures which are meant to hold items or need strength rather than the Grade one. And I am thinking to kind of finish this project right now because Blueprint is ending soon and I got exams. But if Blueprint get extended, I might try to create other of the components in this project too. And for this one, I haven't used Magnet. I know that I haven't used Magnet because the patterns that I created of lines was looking so good and I didn't want to ruin it for the Magnet. So what I have thought is maybe I will after a while insert Magnet externally if needed or I would use this as a separate piece itself.

## 12/29/2025 3 PM - Created Phone stand + power bank deck + SSD holder  

_Time spent: 1.3h_  

# Phone Stand

So I started working with the phone stand. Initially I was thinking to create some cool mechanisms and stuff like that but in the end I have to go back to the basic version only because I don't I am not really familiar too much with fusion 360 and I didn't want it to spend too much time right now. So I created this simple looking design. I took the measurements of my phone it came out to be 80 x 160. So I made the stand according to it only and I used a simple design only but to enhance the texture I was again trying to create something but I didn't wanted to repeat the line pattern that I did in the pen stand. So I tried again I tried with SVGs also to integrate in them in fusion but it was not a reliable so I was trying to search online and I found this cool tool which could help me generate the textures on the file. So I used this to create the texture on it and then it created the textured stl file. So I added that in and due to this texture I couldn't add the magnet in there but though I have the holes for the magnet available in my main step file. So if needed I could always change and add it there but I guess phone stand is fine without using the magnets. I have also added triangular supports in corner to increase the strength

# Power Bank Deck
So currently I have two power banks. One is a bit thick while the other one is thin but long. One is of AMI and another is from Amazon. So I wanted, they were always lying around on my table and didn't had a good spot. So I wanted to create a stand or holder type thing. So I loaded up their dimensions, took them from the Vernier caliper. And then according to their dimensions, I created the holders, added fillets. And though I am not sure about the center of mass or the stability of the full structure, I assume that if it would be unstable, I could add more infill and then reprint it again. Currently it's near 15 to 20% infill only. But this is not a very big print. So it doesn't concern me a lot.

# SSD Holder
Similarly, I have an external SSD, so instead of just hanging it anywhere, I thought to maybe integrate it along with the power bank. So, in the power bank front part, I have given a slot for a magnet, while for the SSD in the back part, I have given. So, I could directly attach it and make it a three-item holder or use it separately.

## 12/29/2025 5 PM - Completed the project!!  

_Time spent: 1.6h_  

# Organizer Tray
So now everything is almost complete. I finished creating the last part, that is, a front tray along with two back containers, which is ideally used to keep objects which are like some spray bottles or some stuff which are usually larger in height. And for example, I even have my toothbrush and toothpaste, so don't ask me why it's in my room. But yeah, so this type of stuff needs to get organized. And it was a crucial part to call my project as the desk organizing system because these things are necessary for the desk. So I was initially thinking to create just a hole with the tray and the two containers. But as it's a modular one, I can simply attach one item to another. So I didn't want it to ruin this one. So initially I did make it that way, but after realizing my mistake, I reverted back the changes and again started to work on the correct part. So I split it in two halves and then for the containers also I created two containers, almost identical and the magnet placements are one one each and in the container also it's detachable. So container also has two parts, which is the container base and the container upper part. So that's connected by one magnet too. If needed, we could remove the container also. We could use those container bases as a separate tray type thing. And the front tray is ideal for my eye wears. I took the measurements and it would fit completely right there and I have given it the smooth curve also. Though I think it would suck while printing, but I don't care. I guess it might turn out good cause I have seen the problem of curved surfaces when going inward, but this is going outward. So I just hope that it would work well.

# Final listings

Now everything is completed, so below is the listing of each item along with its weight and specifications.

I would be using **BambuLab P2S**, so the plate size is a lot bigger than my **A1 mini**. It belongs to my friend, so he would let me use it. That’s why for the slicing I have used that only instead of A1, so objects are bigger than you might think.
